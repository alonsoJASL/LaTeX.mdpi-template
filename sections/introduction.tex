\section{INTRODUCTION}\label{sec:intro}
Cell migration processes are essential in numerous areas,
\emph{e.g} in homoeostasis, where macrophages' 
roles range from tissue repair through to immune responses
to pathogens \cite{wynn2013}, but
%preventing intensive inflammation towards intestinal flora \cite{maloy2011}.
% Defects in cell migration are a major cause of human disease, 
% with excessive migration causing autoimmune diseases and cancer 
% metastasis\cite{pocha2014}.
where excessive migration can lead to autoimmune diseases and cancer \cite{pocha2014}.
Macrophages are cells of the immune system that filter
microbes and foreign particles when settled in lymphoid tissues and the liver
\cite{Martinez2008},  these processes imply sophisticated migration mechanisms.
The use of  \emph{Drosophila Melanogaster} as a  model organism has led to
insights about how the
macrophages integrate cues to migration \cite{wood2017}.
% talk about segmentation and shapes

A precise analysis of the cell shapes as they evolve through time could provide
information for specific cells in biological studies,
% Sharp corners suggest an active migrating cell.
% Rounded corners [suggest] inactivity of the cell.
where sharp corners suggest an active migrating cell and 
rounded corners inactivity.
The interactions amongst the cells' structures appear to anticipate migration
\cite{Stramer2010} and different shape states could hint different movements.
Such an analysis would require an accurate segmentation
that incorporates shape information as it evolves through time.
Segmentation of single frames and in the temporal context is a widely studied
area \cite{mavska2014}. Single frame segmentation of fluorescent microscopy
images involves a broad variety of techniques, like automatic
thresholding \cite{Hannah1995a}, curve evolution techniques such as active
contours, of active surfaces \cite{dufour2005}. On the other hand, tracking
techniques have been used to follow link segmented cells into a track.
Some techniques include the keyhole algorithm \cite{Henry2013} or more
sophisticated techniques that optimise both the tracking
and the segmentation in conjunction \cite{Collins2014}.
In this work a framework to segment, track and analyse the shape of
migrating macrophages is described.
